Accelerated Attributed Network Embedding, SDM 2017


## Code in MATLAB
H = AANE_fun(Net,Attri,d);  
H = AANE_fun(Net,Attri,d,lambda,rho);  
H = AANE_fun(Net,Attri,d,lambda,rho,'Att');  
H = AANE_fun(Net,Attri,d,lambda,rho,'Att',worknum);  

H is the joint embedding representation of Net and Attri, where Net is the weighted adjacency matrix, and Attri is the attribute information matrix with row denotes nodes.
